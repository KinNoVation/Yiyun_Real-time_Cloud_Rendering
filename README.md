# Yiyun's real-time cloud rendering project
Real-time cloud rendering in OpenGL 4.3 compute shader

Currently this project is just a basic ray-caster. Cast ray from the camera in compute shader and intersect with a box.

# Reference
This project based on Anton Gerdelan's tutorials, thanks a lot!
The tutorial: http://antongerdelan.net/opengl/index.html

Check his source code here:

I also learn from David Kuri for ray tracing, check his beautiful tutorial here:

Special thanks to Zheming Gu for helping me build the project.
